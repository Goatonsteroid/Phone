A simple Android phone app that allows users to make outgoing calls, view the call log, and see their contacts from the device's contact list.
Features
1. Outgoing Calls
The app allows users to make outgoing calls directly from the app. The contact list is displayed, and tapping on a contact will initiate the call.

The app fetches contacts from the device's contact book and displays them in a list. Each contact shows the name and phone number.
Contacts can be searched through the integrated search bar to find specific contacts quickly.
